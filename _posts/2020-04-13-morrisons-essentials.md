title: Morrisons Essentials
description: If, like me, you believe bacon to be an essential ingredient in
  your shop, then you'll also agree that Morrisons might have thought to include
  some worthy bread rolls and a little brown sauce. There is a veggie option
  available too (but why oh why would anyone want fake tuna?)
